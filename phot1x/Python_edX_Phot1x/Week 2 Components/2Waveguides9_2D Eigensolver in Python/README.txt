EMpy is used for sovling 2D waveguide mode.

EMpy (Electromagnetic Python) (not to be confused with empy) is a suite of numerical algorithms widely used in electromagnetism.

The package contains:

an isotropic and anisotropic transfer matrix algorithm;
an isotropic and anisotropic rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) algorithm;
the numerical model of the frequency response of different well-known devices (Mach-Zehnder, Ring Resonators, etc.).
This list, very short by now, will hopefully enlarge to include an FDTD and an interface to the many very good software used in electromagnetism out there.
