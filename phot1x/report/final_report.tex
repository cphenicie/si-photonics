\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

In this work, we will measure the group index of a silicon photonic waveguide taking advantage of high-sensitivity interferometry. The proposed chip will contain a total of seven interferometers. With a proper understanding of the transfer function of an interferometer as the length imbalance of the two legs ($\Delta$L) is changed, it is possible to make a careful measurement of the group index of the waveguides the interferometer is composed of. The proposed chip will include two different interferometer geometries, Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) to make measurements for relatively small imbalances ($\Delta$L $\sim 100\mu$m), and Michelson interferometers (MIs) to make meausurements for relatively large imbalances ($\Delta$L $>$ 1 mm). We choose to work with MIs for this application because the geometry allows for longer length imbalances given the same amount of space on a chip. These interferometers will be sensitive to small changes in the group index due to fabrication imperfections, and we can bound the fabrication imperfections based on the observed variations in the transfer function.

\section{Theory}
\label{sec:theory}

The group index of a material can be measured from the transfer function of an unbalanced interferometer of known length difference $\Delta L$. Let us consider the case of an interferometer composed of lossless Si photonic waveguides. As described in~\cite{Chrostowski2015}, an MZI can be built on a silicon photonic chip using two Y-branches, one as a splitter to split the incoming light between two waveguides of length $L_1$ and $L_2$, and the other Y-branch used as a coupler to allow the light to interfere. We can describe the power measured at the output of the interferometer as follows:

First, the incoming light described by the electric field $E_i$ is split into the two branches of the Y-branch equally, meaning the field into the two waveguides are $E_1 = E_2 = \frac{E_i}{\sqrt{2}}$. These fields are then propagated along the waveguides, which have effective index $n_1$ and $n_2$ and lengths $L_1$ and $L_2$ respectively. Therefore, the fields at the opposite end of the waveguides are $E_{o1} = \frac{E_i}{\sqrt{2}} e^{-i \beta_1 L_1}$ and $E_{o2} = \frac{E_i}{\sqrt{2}} e^{-i \beta_2 L_2}$ where we define the propagation constant 

\begin{equation}
\beta = \frac{2\pi n}{\lambda}
\label{eq:beta}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the (effective) index of refraction of the waveguide, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light.

The combining Y-branch will then mix these two fields, producing the output field 

\begin{equation}
E_o = \frac{E_{o1} + E_{o2}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{E_i}{2} \left(e^{-i \beta_1 L_1} + e^{-i \beta_2 L_2} \right)
\end{equation}

In these experiments, we will only consider the intensity of the output light $I_o = |E_o|^2$, which can be simplified to the final equation which we will refer to as the transfer function of the MZI:

\begin{equation}
I_o/I_i = \frac{1}{2} (1 + \cos{(\beta_1 L_1 - \beta_2 L_2)})
\label{eq:trans_full}
\end{equation}

For now, we will assume that the waveguides are made of identical material, such that $\beta_1 = \beta_2 = \frac{2 \pi n_{\text{eff}}}{\lambda}$ where $n_{\text{eff}}$ is the effective index of the waveguide. Then, defining the difference in the path lengths of the two legs of the interferometer $\Delta L = L_2 - L_1$, we arrive at the following equation for the tranfer function of the imbalanced MZI with waveguides made of identical material:

\begin{equation}
\frac{I_o}{I_i} = \frac{1}{2} \left(1 + \cos{(\beta \Delta_L)}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \left(1 + \cos{\left(\frac{2\pi n_{\text{eff}} \Delta_L}{\lambda}\right)}\right)
\label{eq:trans_simple}
\end{equation}

Note that this is a periodic function that varies with the wavelength of the light $\lambda$. So, if we take a spectrum of this device, that is, measure $I_o$ for a range of different wavelengths, we should see a periodic pattern, undergoing one full oscillation between the wavelength $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ satisfying the relationship 

\begin{equation}
|\beta(\lambda_1) - \beta(\lambda_2)| \Delta L = 2 \pi
\label{eq:FSR_cond}
\end{equation}
where $\beta$ depends on wavelength both from the appearance of $\lambda$ in the denominator of equation \ref{eq:beta}, but also because the index of refraction of materials (especially the effective index of the photonic waveguide) is wavelength dependent.  

We can then approximate equation \ref{eq:FSR_cond} by assuming that the wavelength difference is small enough that we have

\begin{equation}
(\beta(\lambda_1) - \beta(\lambda_2)) \approx \frac{d\beta}{d\lambda} \Delta \lambda
\label{eq:deltabeta}
\end{equation}

Differentiating equation \ref{eq:beta}, we have

\begin{equation}
\frac{d\beta}{d\lambda} = 2\pi\left(\frac{dn}{d\lambda}\frac{1}{\lambda} - \frac{n}{\lambda^2} \right) = - \frac{2\pi  n_g}{\lambda^2}
\label{eq:dbeta}
\end{equation}
where we have used the definition of the group index 

\begin{equation}
n_g = n - \lambda \frac{dn}{d \lambda}
\label{eq:ngdef}
\end{equation}


Plugging equations \ref{eq:deltabeta} and  \ref{eq:dbeta} back into equation \ref{eq:FSR_cond}, we have that the spacing $\Delta \lambda$ corresponding to one full oscillation (the FSR) is 

\begin{equation}
FSR = \frac{\lambda^2}{n_g \Delta L}
\label{eq:FSR}
\end{equation}

So, if we find the peaks of the spectrum around the wavelength of interest and find the average spacing between them, $FSR$, we can solve for the group index using the formula

\begin{equation}
n_g = \frac{\lambda^2}{FSR \times \Delta L}
\label{eq:solveng}
\end{equation}

We could use equation \ref{eq:solveng} to calculate the group index from the transmission the spectrum of and MZI, however we will be able to get an even better estimate of the waveguide parameters fitting to the full transfer function in equation \ref{eq:trans_simple}. We do this to generate a ``compact model" of the waveguides in the MZIs and MIs, and compare this with the models that will be computed in section \ref{sec:model}. Note that the transfer function for the MI is the same as the MZI, but one must take care to account for both passes along the legs of the interferometer to compute the true $\Delta$L.

%We can then test the variability of this value due to fabrication imperfections. To maximize sensitivity to imperfections, we will use a long path length difference between the two legs, and use a Michelson interferometer (which gives twice the path length difference for the same length imbalance as the MZI). 

%We can compute the variation in the FSR between the different devices to put a bound on the variation in the width of the waveguide. Specifically, we can bound this by assuming all the observed variation is due to width variations. Then, differentiating equations \ref{eq:FSR} with respect to the waveguide width, we find
%
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{d(FSR)}{dw} = \frac{-\lambda^2}{\Delta L \, n_g^2} \frac{dn_g}{dw}
%\end{equation}
%where recall that for a Michelson interferometer $\Delta L$ is twice the length imbalance. The quantity $\frac{dn_g}{dw}$ can be computed in simulation, so that we can arrive at the following equation relating the measured difference in FSR to the implied maximum width variation:
%
%\begin{equation}
%\Delta w = - \frac{\Delta (FSR) \times \Delta L \times n_g^2}{\lambda^2 \times \frac{dn_g}{dw}}
%\label{eq:dw}
%\end{equation}

\section{Modeling and simulation}
\label{sec:model}


The interferometers were composed of strip waveguides etched into an SOI chip with a 220 nm thick Si layer and a capping oxide layer. The designed widths of the waveguides were 500nm, and light was coupled into the TE mode of the waveguide. This structure can be simulated using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) technique. As an example, the spatial distribution of the waveguide mode from this FDTD simulation is shown in figure \ref{fig:mode}

\begin{figure}[t!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 3.25in]{fig/waveguide_TE.jpg}
  \caption{FDTD simulation of quasi-TE mode of the waveguides used in this work, computed using Lumerical MODE. This image is oriented in a plane perpendicular to the direction of light propagation.}
  \label{fig:mode}
\end{figure}

One of the essential parameters needed to predict the properties of the MZI is the index of refraction. More specifically, it is important to have an understanding of the effective index of refraction ($n_{\text{eff}}$) which determines the phase velocity of light in the medium. Additionally, if $n_{\text{eff}}$ is known as a function of wavelength, it can be used to compute the group index of medium ($n_g$), which is ultimately the quantity needed to predict the behavior of the MZI. These parameters can be extracted from the FDTD simulation, as shown in figures \ref{fig:neff} and \ref{fig:ng}. 

\begin{figure}[t!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 3.25in]{fig/waveguide_dispersion_narrow.png}
  \caption{Variations in the effective index of the proposed waveguide as a function of wavelength. Values are computed from FDTD simulations in Lumerical MODE.}

\end{figure}

  \includegraphics[width = 3.25in]{fig/group_index_narrow.png}
  \caption{Variations in the group index of the proposed waveguide as a function of wavelength. Values are computed from FDTD simulations in Lumerical MODE, and are generally in agreement with the simulated effective index.}
  \label{fig:ng}
\end{figure}

This information can then be distilled into a compact model for this waveguide by fitting the effective index to a low-order polynomial:

\begin{equation}
n(\lambda)\approx a_0 + a_1(\lambda - \lambda_0) + a_2(\lambda - \lambda_0)^2
\label{eq:cm}
\end{equation}

Where we arrive at the following fit parameters from the FDTD simulations (for wavelength in units of $\mu$m):

$ a_0 = 2.4489, a_1 = -1.1337, a_2 = -0.0451 $.

Note that if we use this compact model along with equation \ref{eq:ngdef}, we find good agreement between the simulated and calculated values of the group index.

Armed with this knowledge, we can now simulate the two proposed devices and see how the simulations compare to the predictions from the equations laid out in section \ref{sec:theory}.

The basic MZI circuit will be composed of Y-branches on the input and output, with each leg of the interferometer composed of a strip waveguide of varying length or width, as shown in figure \ref{fig:schematic}.

  \label{fig:schematic}
\end{figure}

We can simulate the behavior of this device in Lumerical INTERCONNECT, as shown in figure \ref{fig:deltaL}. We can see the calculated FSR from these simulations are well captured by the transfer function of the MZI (eq \ref{eq:trans_simple}) and the predicted FSR computed from it (i.e. eq \ref{eq:FSR}), as shown in table \ref{tab:MZI}.

The proposed Michelson interferometer is shown in figure \ref{fig:mich-scheme}, where we have used loop waveguides as mirrors and we are using broadband directional couplers to split the light in order to be able to measure the reflected signal. Note the large length imbalance of the two branches.

\begin{figure}[t!]

  \caption{Schematic of the proposed Michelson interferometer.}
  \label{fig:mich-scheme}
\end{figure}

%We can simulate the transfer function of this device in Lumerical INTERCONNECT for waveguides of width 500nm and 510nm. The spectrum contains many oscillations, but we can see that there is a phase shift of $\pi$ between the devices in just a 5nm bandwidth, as shown in figures \ref{fig:mich-in} and \ref{fig:mich-out}. If we compute the change in FSR between the entire 50nm bandwidth of the grating couplers, we should have sensitivity much better than this.

%  \label{fig:mich-out}
%\end{figure}

%As a sanity check that this analysis should work, we can calculate the difference in FSR between these two data sets and plug this into equation \ref{eq:dw}. Before we can do this, we need to compute a value of $\frac{dn_g}{dw}$. This can be done by simulating $n_g$ near 1550nm for a few different waveguide widths in Lumerical MODE, and performing a linear fit on the resulting data, as shown in figure \ref{fig:dngdw}, which gives a value of $-1.691 \times 10^{-3} \text{nm}^{-1}$. From this, we can calculate a difference in width $\Delta w = 9.6$ nm on a pair of simulations that had a difference in width of 10 nm.

Finally, we show the proposed layout for all the devices on this chip in figure \ref{fig:layout}. This design was built using the SiEPIC PDK and is compact enough to fit into an area of $605 \mu m \times 410 \mu m $.

\end{figure}

\section{Fabrication variability analysis}

The above simulations were computed assuming an ideal waveguide that is 500 nm wide and 220 nm thick. In reality, we expect there to be variations from device to device due to imperfections in the thickness of the Si layer in the SOI wafer as well as imperfections in the fabrication of the waveguide. A corner analysis of the expected variations in waveguide properties as well as device characteristics given an up to 1 standard deviation variation in these parameters is shown in table \ref{tab:corner}. Note that the values of $n_{\text{eff}}$ and $n_g$ were computed through FDTD simulation using the specified width and  thickness, and the FSR was calculated for a simulated MZI with a length imbalance of 100 $\mu m$ using the resulting compact model of the waveguide.

\begin{table}

\begin{tabular}{ r | r | r | r }
  \hline

The width range is an estimate of the variability in waveguide thickness form past fabrication runs at the SiEPIC foundry.}
\label{tab:corner}
\end{table}



\section{Final device performance and analysis}


To obtain a more precise estimate for $n_g$, the transmission spectrum of each of the MZIs in the device can be fit to the functional form of equation \ref{eq:trans_simple}, where the effective index is parameterized by the compact model described in equation \ref{eq:cm}. From this compact model, one can compute the group index from equation \ref{eq:ngdef}. Using this compact model, we arrive at the following expression for the group index:

\begin{equation}
n_g = a_0 - a_1 \lambda_0 + a_2(\lambda_0^2 - \lambda^2)
\label{eq:ng_from_cm}
\end{equation}

From the fit, we may also extract the parameter uncertainties for the $a_i$ coefficients, $\sigma_{a_i}$. We can then propagate error through equation \ref{eq:ng_from_cm} via

\begin{equation}
\sigma^2_{n_g} = \sum_i \sigma^2_{a_i} \left( \frac{\partial n_g}{\partial a_i} \right)^2
\end{equation}

arriving at the expression for the (1$\sigma$) uncertainty in the group index:

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{n_g} = \sqrt{\sigma^2_{a_0} + \sigma^2_{a_1} \lambda_0^2}
\end{equation}

An example of one of the fits to the MZI transmission spectrum is shown in figure \ref{fig:transFit}. The calculated compact model from each of the interferometers in the device is shown in figure~\ref{fig:ngs}. The fit parameters and uncertainties as well as the resulting fit and uncertainties in $n_g$ and FSR are shown in table \ref{tab:summary}. In general, we find precise estimates for the group index that are generally in agreement with each other, though the device-to-device variation seems to be higher than the fit uncertainties. We also note to good agreement between the measured FSR and the simulated and calculated values listed in table \ref{tab:MZI}.


\begin{figure}[t!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 3.25in]{fig/500um_MZI_fit.png}
  \caption{Fit to the transmission spectrum of the MZI with $\Delta L = 500\mu$m. The loopback data is from two grating couplers connected directly to each other in order to de-embed the losses from the grating couplers themselves. Normalizing the raw data to this envelope results in a tranfer function well-approximated by the fit to equation \ref{eq:trans_simple} and a 2nd order compact model for the waveguide index.}
  \label{fig:transFit}
\end{figure}

%Note that these fits are generally in good agreement. The fit for the $\Delta L = 30\mu$m device is likely the result of fit uncertainty rather than meaningfully difference behavior in the device. This could be quantified via the uncertainties in each of the fit parameters, which are themselves listed in table~\ref{tab:summary}.

% Note, however, that these fit uncertainties appear quite small. In order to make sure this is not the result of over-fitting, it would be prudent to do a sensitivity analysis of deviation of the final transmission profiles with each of these fit parameters.

\section{Future work}

This work established the technique to measure the group index of fabricated waveguides using interferometry. There are a few extensions to this work that would improve the results. In this work, the transfer function of each interferometer is fit separately and any loss beyond that caused by the grating couplers is normalized to unity transmission via a free ``device loss" parameter in the model. This was needed because the loopback to calibrate the losses in the waveguide were not completely representative of all the losses in the system (for instance, through Y-branches). However, it is likely that there is a uniquely identifiable loss from each component as well as absorption in the waveguides themselves. These parameters could be determined through more independent measurements of the individual components to calibrate out that loss, and a simultaneous fit on the MZI transfer functions to fit a single absorption loss in the waveguides. Additionally, the use of longer $\Delta$L and more stable lasers would be able to increase the precision of these fits. Finally, testing of more identical devices would yield a better estimate of the variation due to fabrication imperfections alone.

\section{Fabrication and measurement}
% 
% The waveguides used in this device will be fabricated on SOI wafer with a 220nm layer of Si on a buried oxide (BOX), and the waveguides will be fabricated to be 500 nm wide, with light coupled in via the quasi-TE mode of the waveguide. A finite-difference time domain (FDTD) simulation of this structure (shown in cross section, with an additional oxide capping layer) is shown in figure \ref{fig:mode}, with the spatial extent of the amplitude of the TE mode also shown.

The photonic devices were fabricated using the NanoSOI MPW fabrication process by Applied Nanotools~\cite{ANT} which is based on direct-write 100 keV electron beam lithography technology. Silicon-on-insulator wafers of 200 mm diameter, 220 nm device thickness and 2 $\mu$m buffer oxide thickness are used as the base material for the fabrication. The wafer was pre-diced into square substrates with dimensions of 25x25 mm, and lines were scribed into the substrate backsides to facilitate easy separation into smaller chips once fabrication was complete. After an initial wafer clean using piranha solution (3:1 H$_2$SO$_4$:H$_2$O$_2$) for 15 minutes and water/IPA rinse, hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) resist was spin-coated onto the substrate and heated to evaporate the solvent. The photonic devices were patterned using a Raith EBPG 5000+ electron beam instrument using a raster step size of 5 nm. The exposure dosage of the design was corrected for proximity effects that result from the backscatter of electrons from exposure of nearby features. Shape writing order was optimized for efficient patterning and minimal beam drift. After the e-beam exposure and subsequent development with a tetramethylammonium sulfate (TMAH) solution, the devices were inspected optically for residues and/or defects. The chips were then mounted on a 4” handle wafer and underwent an anisotropic ICP-RIE etch process using chlorine after qualification of the etch rate. The resist was removed from the surface of the devices using a 10:1 buffer oxide wet etch, and the devices were inspected using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to verify patterning and etch quality. A 2.2 $\mu$m oxide cladding was deposited using a plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) process based on tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) at 300$^{\text{o}}$C. Reflectrometry measurements were performed throughout the process to verify the device layer, buffer oxide and cladding thicknesses before delivery.

To characterize the devices, a custom-built automated test setup~\cite{Chrostowski2015, MLP} with automated control software written in Python was used~\cite{siepic}.  An Agilent 81600B tunable laser was used as the input source and Agilent 81635A optical power sensors as the output detectors. The wavelength was swept from 1500 to 1600 nm in 10 pm steps.  A polarization maintaining (PM) fiber array was used to couple light in/out of the chip~\cite{PLC}. This maintained the polarization state of the light to couple the TE polarization into the grating couplers~\cite{Wang2014}.
